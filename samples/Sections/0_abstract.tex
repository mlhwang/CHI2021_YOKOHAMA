Nutrition is a crucial part of healthy living, however, individuals often struggle to understand and make healthy choices. Past HCI work, particularly in health, has shown the power of gamification in promoting engagement with and understanding of complex information. Leveraging gamification techniques (avatars and crowdsourced feedback) to help people engage with nutrition, we developed Monster Munch, a mobile application where users help monster avatars achieve a particular health goal (e.g., lose weight) by selecting crowdsourced ``in-the-wild'' meals to feed them. We piloted Monster Munch (N=68) and found users' confidence assessing macronutrients increased after using the app. Strong player-avatar-identification (PAID) and increased utilization of the crowdsourced community board were related to users' enjoyment of the app. Interestingly, lower PAID predicted greater recall of nutrition information, independent of prior nutrition knowledge. Findings suggest PAID may be an important mechanism in learning and highlights how fun, lightweight tools can prompt reflection and recall.

Nutrition is a crucial part of healthy living, however, individuals often struggle to understand and make healthy choices. Past HCI work, particularly in health, has shown the power of gamification in promoting engagement with and understanding of complex information. Leveraging gamification techniques (avatars and crowdsourced feedback) to help people engage with nutrition, we developed Monster Munch, a mobile application where users help monster avatars achieve a particular health goal (e.g., lose weight) by selecting crowdsourced “in-the-wild” meals to feed them. We piloted Monster Munch (N=68) and found users' confidence assessing macronutrients increased after using the app. Strong player-avatar-identification (PAID) and increased utilization of the crowdsourced community board were related to users' enjoyment of the app. Interestingly, lower PAID predicted greater recall of nutrition information, independent of prior nutrition knowledge. Findings suggest PAID may be an important mechanism in learning and highlights how fun, lightweight tools can prompt reflection and recall.

% Gamification features engage with nutrition:

% PAID differs across education (t = 3…., p = 0.003). Lower ed group related more to avatars.

% Avatar: 
% High Person avatar ID associated with high enjoyment of game. ID is a sig predictor 
% - High identification with avatar is high enjoyment of game
% - High identification with avatar is high game rating
% - High identification with avatar is high game recommend

% Community Board:
% - Community board influence is higher game enjoyment
% - Community board influence is higher game rate
% - Community board influence is higher game recommend 

% Confidence about nutrition increased.
% - Confidence: Improved across significant game
% - PAID score nor education does 

% Didn’t expect to see learning because because play
% - Learning: Recall improves significantly (p = .02)
% - PAID score predicts post recall even when controlling for pre-recall

% PAID score predicts community board agreement, community board influence
